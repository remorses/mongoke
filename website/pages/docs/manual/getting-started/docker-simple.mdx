Quickstart with Docker
======================

Table of contents

This guide will help you get the Hasura GraphQL engine and Postgres
running as Docker containers using Docker Compose. This is the easiest
way to set up Hasura GraphQL engine on your **local environment**.

In case you\'d like to run Hasura on an existing Postgres database,
follow this guide to
`deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine as a standalone docker container
<deployment_docker>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and connect it to
your Postgres instance.

Prerequisites
-------------

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Step 1: Get the docker-compose file
-----------------------------------

The
[hasura/graphql-engine/install-manifests](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/stable/install-manifests)
repo contains all installation manifests required to deploy Hasura
anywhere. Get the docker compose file from there:

```bash
# in a new directory
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml
```

Step 2: Run Hasura GraphQL engine & Postgres
--------------------------------------------

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Check if the containers are running:

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...
```

Step 3: Open the Hasura console
-------------------------------

Head to `http://localhost:8080/console` to open the Hasura console.

Hello World (GraphQL or event triggers)
---------------------------------------

Make your `first graphql query <first_graphql_query>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}

OR

Set up your
`first event trigger <first_event_trigger>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}

running quickly. For more detailed instructions on deploying using
Docker, check out `deployment_docker`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
