Modelling one-to-one table relationships
========================================

Table of contents

A `one-to-one` relationship between two tables can be established via a
**unique foreign key constraint**.

Say we have the following two tables in our database schema:

```sql
author (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
)

passport_info (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  owner_id INT NOT NULL
  passport_number TEXT
  ...
)
```

These two tables are related via a `one-to-one` relationship. i.e.:

-   an `author` can have one `passport_info`
-   a `passport_info` has one `owner`

Set up a table relationship in the database
-------------------------------------------

This `one-to-one` relationship can be established in the database by:

1.  Adding a **foreign key constraint** from the `passport_info` table
    to the `author` table using the `owner_id` and `id` columns of the
    tables respectively
2.  Adding a **unique constraint** to the `owner_id` column for the
    `passport_info` table

This will ensure that the value of the `owner_id` column in
`passport_info` table is present in the `id` column of the `author`
table and there will be only one row with a particular `owner_id`.

Set up GraphQL relationships
----------------------------

To access the nested objects via the GraphQL API,
`create the following relationships <create_relationships>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}:

-   Object relationship, `passport_info` from the `author` table using
    `id -> passport_info :: owner_id`
-   Object relationship, `owner` from the `passport_info` table using
    `owner_id -> author :: id`

Query using relationships
-------------------------

We can now:

-   fetch a list of authors with their `passport_info`:

          author {
        id
        name
        passport_info {
          id
          passport_number
        }
      }
    
    
-   fetch a list of passport\_infos with their `owner`:

          passport_info {
        id
        passport_number
        owner {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    
    
Current limitations with nested mutations
-----------------------------------------

With one-to-one relationships, currently nested mutations will work only
in one of the two directions.

In our example, inserting a `passport_info` with their nested `owner`
will work seamlessly but trying to insert an `author` with their nested
`passport_info` will throw a constraint violation error.

This is due to the way Hasura GraphQL engine currently handles nested
mutations (described in detail `here <nested_inserts>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}). As nested object relations are inserted before the parent,
the `passport_info` will be attempted to be inserted first and the value
of its `owner_id` will be attempted to be set as the `id` of the
`author`. Due to this, based on whether the `owner_id` of
`passport_info` is nullable or not, a `Not-NULL violation` error will be
thrown either for the `owner_id` field of `passport_info` or the `id`
field of `author`.
