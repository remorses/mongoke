Renaming relationships
======================

Table of contents

To rename a relationship:

-   Head to `Data -> [table-name] -> Relationships` in the console
-   Drop the existing relationship
-   Recreate the relationship with the new name

Note

You might not be allowed to drop a relationship if it has been
referenced elsewhere (e.g. in a permissions rule).

In this case you will have to delete the references first, rename the
relationship, and then re-add the references.
