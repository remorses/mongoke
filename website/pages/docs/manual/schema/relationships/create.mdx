Creating relationships
======================

Table of contents

A relationship from one table/view to another can be created by defining
a link between a column of the table/view to a column of the other
table/view.

Typically, relationships are defined using foreign-key constraints. But
in some cases, it might not be possible to use foreign-key constraints
to create the relation. For example, while trying to create a
relationship involving a view as foreign-keys can\'t be created on
views.

Using foreign keys
------------------

Say we created two tables, `author(id, name)` and
`article(id, title, content, rating, author_id)`.

Let us now connect these tables to enable nested queries using a
foreign-key:

### Step 1: Add foreign-key constraint

In the console, navigate to the `Modify` tab of the `article` table.
Click the `Add` button in the Foreign Keys section and configure the
`author_id` column as a foreign-key for the `id` column in the `author`
table:

### Step 2: Create an object relationship

Each article has one author. This is an `object relationship`.

The console infers this using the foreign-key created above and
recommends the potential relationship in the `Relationships` tab of the
`article` table.

Add an `object relationship` named `author` for the `article` table as
shown here:

/img/graphql/manual/schema/add-1-1-relationship.png

We can now run a nested object query that is based on this
`object relationship`.

Fetch a list of articles and each article\'s author:

  article {
    id
    title
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }


### Step 3: Create an array relationship

An author can write multiple articles. This is an `array relationship`.

You can add an `array relationship` in the same fashion as an
`object relationship` as shown above.

Add an `array relationship` named `articles` for the `author` table as
shown here:

/img/graphql/manual/schema/add-1-many-relationship.png

We can now run a nested object query that is based on this
`array relationship`.

Fetch a list of authors and a nested list of each author\'s articles:

  author {
    id
    name
    articles {
      id
      title
    }
  }


Using manual relationships
--------------------------

Let\'s say you have a table `author (id, name)` and a view
`author_avg_rating (id, avg)` which has the average rating of articles
for each author.

Let us now create an `object relationship` called `avg_rating` from the
`author` table to the `author_avg_rating` view using a manual
relationship:

### Step 1: Open the manual relationship section

-   Open the console and navigate to the
    `Data -> author -> Relationships` tab.
-   Click on the `Configure` button:

/img/graphql/manual/schema/manual-relationship-btn.png

### Step 2: Define the relationship

The above step will open up a section as shown below:

/img/graphql/manual/schema/manual-relationship-create.png

In this case:

-   **Relationship Type** will be: `Object Relationship`
-   **Relationship Name** can be: `avg_rating`
-   **Reference** will be: `id -> author_avg_rating . id` *(similar to
    defining a foreign-key)*

### Step 3: Create the relationship

Now click on the `Save` button to create the relationship.

We can now run a nested object query that is based on this
`object relationship`.

Fetch a list of authors with the average rating of their articles:

  author {
    id
    name
    avg_rating {
      avg
    }
  }
