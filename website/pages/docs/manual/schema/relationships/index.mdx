Relationships between tables/views
==================================

Table of contents

To make
`nested object queries <nested_object_queries>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, the tables/views in your database need to be connected via
relationships.

Let\'s say we have the following tables in our database: `author`,
`passport_info`, `article` and `tag`.

Table relationships
-------------------

The tables/views in any relational database are typically related to
each other via one of the following types of table relationships:

+------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------+
| Type       | Example               | Meaning                        |
+============+=======================+================================+
| `one-to-on | `author` and          | -   an `author` can have one   |
| e`         | `passport_info`       |     `passport_info`            |
|            |                       | -   a `passport_info` can have |
|            |                       |     one `owner`                |
+------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------+
| `one-to-ma | `author` and          | -   an `author` can have many  |
| ny`        | `article`             |     `articles`                 |
|            |                       | -   an `article` can have one  |
|            |                       |     `author`                   |
+------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------+
| `many-to-m | `article` and `tag`   | -   an `article` can have many |
| any`       |                       |     `tags`                     |
|            |                       | -   a `tag` can have many      |
|            |                       |     `articles`                 |

GraphQL schema relationships
----------------------------

Each table relationship, as you can see from the above section, will
have two component relationships (one in either direction) in the
GraphQL schema. These relationships can be one of the following types:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Type                    Example           Meaning
  ----------------------- ----------------- ------------------------------------
  `object relationship`   an `article` can  an `article` object will have a
  (one-to-one)            have one `author` single nested author object called
                                            `author`

  `array relationship`    an `author` can   an `author` object will have an
  (one-to-many)           have many         array of nested article objects
                          `articles`        called `articles`
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note

The relationship name is used to refer to the nested objects in queries.
For example, \"`articles`\" of an `author` and \"`author`\" of an
`article`.

Managing GraphQL relationships
------------------------------

See the following to manage the object/array relationships between
tables/views for the GraphQL schema:

-   `create_relationships`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `rename_relationships`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

Table relationships modelling guides
------------------------------------

The following guides will help you model the different types of table
relationships in the database:

-   `one_to_one_modelling`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `one_to_many_modelling`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `many_to_many_modelling`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
