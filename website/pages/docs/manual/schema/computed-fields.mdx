What are computed fields?
-------------------------

Computed fields are virtual values or objects that are dynamically
computed and can be queried along with a table\'s columns. Computed
fields are computed when requested for via [custom SQL
functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html)
using other columns of the table and other custom inputs if needed.

Note

Computed fields are only exposed over the GraphQL API and the database
schema is not modified on addition of a computed field.

### Supported SQL functions

Only functions which satisfy the following constraints can be added as a
computed field to a table. (*terminology from* [Postgres
docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html)):

-   **Function behaviour**: ONLY `STABLE` or `IMMUTABLE`
-   **Argument modes**: ONLY `IN`
-   **Table Argument**: One input argument with a table row type
-   **Return type**: Either `SETOF <table-name>` or `BASE` type

Note

Functions used as computed fields can also accept other arguments other
than the mandatory table row argument. Values for these extra arguments
can be passed as arguments to the computed field in the GraphQL API.

Computed field types
--------------------

Based on the SQL function\'s return type, we can define two types of
computed fields:

### 1. Scalar computed fields

Computed fields whose associated SQL function returns a [base
type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-type-system.html#id-1.8.3.5.9)
like *Integer*, *Boolean*, *Geography* etc. are scalar computed fields.

**Example:**

The `author` table has two `text` columns: `first_name` and `last_name`.

Define an SQL function called `author_full_name`:

```plpgsql
CREATE FUNCTION author_full_name(author_row author)
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
  SELECT author_row.first_name || ' ' || author_row.last_name
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE;
```

`Add a computed field <add-computed-field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} called `full_name` to the `author` table using the SQL
function above.

Query data from the `author` table:

  author {
    id
    first_name
    last_name
    full_name
  }


### 2. Table computed fields

Computed fields whose associated SQL function returns
`SETOF <table-name>` are table computed fields. The return table must be
tracked to define such a computed field.

**Example:**

In a simple `author <-> article` schema, we can define a
`relationship <relationships>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} on the
`author` table to fetch authors along with their articles.

We can make use of computed fields to fetch the author\'s articles with
a search parameter.

Define an SQL function called `filter_author_articles`:

```plpgsql
CREATE FUNCTION filter_author_articles(author_row author, search text)
RETURNS SETOF article AS $$
  SELECT *
  FROM article
  WHERE
    ( title ilike ('%' || search || '%')
      OR content ilike ('%' || search || '%')
    ) AND author_id = author_row.id
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE;
```

`Add a computed field <add-computed-field>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} called `filtered_articles` to the `author` table using the
SQL function above.

Query data from the `author` table:

  author {
    id
    first_name
    last_name
    filtered_articles(args: {search: \"Hasura\"}){
      id
      title
      content
    }
  }


Adding a computed field to a table
----------------------------------

api\_tabs

Console

Head to the `Modify` tab of the table and click on the `Add` button in
the `Computed fields` section:

/img/graphql/manual/schema/computed-field-create.png

Supported from

Console support is available in `v1.1.0` and above

API

A computed field can be added to a table using the
`add_computed_field <api_computed_field>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
metadata API

Computed fields permissions
---------------------------

`Access control <authorization>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
computed fields depends on the type of computed field.

-   For **scalar computed fields**, permissions are managed similar to
    the `columns permissions <col-level-permissions>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} of the table.
-   For **table computed fields**, the permissions set on the return
    table are respected.

Computed fields vs. Postgres generated columns
----------------------------------------------

Postgres, from version `12`, is introducing [Generated
Columns](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-generated-columns.html).
The value of generated columns is also computed from other columns of a
table. Postgres\' generated columns come with their own limitations.
Hasura\'s computed fields are defined via an SQL function, which allows
users to define any complex business logic in a function. Generated
columns will go together with computed fields where Hasura treats
generated columns as normal Postgres columns.
