Extend schema with views
========================

Table of contents

What are views?
---------------

[Views](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html) can
be used to expose the results of a custom query as a virtual table.
Views are not persisted physically i.e. the query defining a view is
executed whenever data is requested from the view.

Hasura GraphQL engine lets you expose views over the GraphQL API to
allow querying them using both `queries` and `subscriptions` just like
regular tables.

Creating & exposing views
-------------------------

Views can be created using SQL which can be run in the Hasura console:

-   Head to the `Data -> SQL` section of the Hasura console
-   Enter your [create view SQL
    statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createview.html)
-   Select the `Track this` checkbox to expose the new view over the
    GraphQL API
-   Hit the `Run` button

Use cases
---------

Views are ideal solutions for retrieving some derived data based on some
custom business logic. If your custom logic requires any user input, you
should use
`custom SQL functions <custom_sql_functions>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} instead.

Let\'s see a few example use cases for views:

### Example: Group by and then aggregate

Let's see how to fetch the average article rating for each author in our
author/article schema.

A view that averages the rating of articles for each author can be
created using the following SQL query:

```SQL
CREATE VIEW author_average_rating AS
  SELECT author_id, avg(rating)
    FROM article
    GROUP BY author_id
```

### Example: Hide certain fields of a table

Say, we have some sensitive information in a table which we wouldn\'t
want to expose. We can create a view that only exposes the non-sensitive
fields.

Let\'s say our `author` table has the fields
`id, name, city, email, phone, address` and we want to hide the `email`,
`phone` and `address` fields. We can create the following view to
achieve this:

```SQL
CREATE VIEW author_public AS
  SELECT id, name, city
    FROM author
```
