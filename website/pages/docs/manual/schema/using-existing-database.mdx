Setting up a GraphQL schema using an existing database
======================================================

Table of contents

When you have an existing database with a schema already present, you
don\'t need to create tables or views or run DDL queries through the
Hasura console.

All you need to do is indicate to Hasura GraphQL engine which tables and
views you want to expose over GraphQL and how they are connected to each
other so that you can query them as a \"graph\".

Step 1: Track tables/views
--------------------------

Tracking a table or a view means telling Hasura GraphQL engine that you
want to expose that table/view over GraphQL.

### To track a table or a view:

1.  Head to the `Data -> Schema` section of the console.
2.  Under the heading `Untracked Tables/Views`, click on the `Track`
    button next to the table/view name.

### To track all tables and views present in the database:

1.  Head to the `Data -> Schema` section of the console.
2.  Under the heading `Untracked Tables/Views`, click the `Track All`
    button.

Step 2: Track foreign-keys
--------------------------

Tracking a foreign-key means creating a
`relationship <relationships>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} between the
tables involved in the foreign-key.

### To track a foreign-key between two tables in the database:

1.  Head to the `Data -> Schema` section of the console.
2.  Click on a table involved in the foreign-key and head to the
    `Relationships` tab.
3.  You should see a suggested relationship based on the foreign-key.
    Click `Add`, give a name to your relationship (this will be the name
    of the `nested object <nested_object_queries>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} in the GraphQL query), and hit `Save` to create the
    relationship.
4.  Repeat with the other table involved in the foreign-key.

### To track all the foreign-keys of all tables in the database:

1.  Head to the `Data -> Schema` section of the console.
2.  Under the heading `Untracked foreign-key relations`, click the
    `Track All` button to automatically create relationships based on
    the foreign-keys.

Relationship nomenclature

In this case, Hasura GraphQL engine will **automatically generate
relationship names** (the names of the
`nested objects <nested_object_queries>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
in the GraphQL query) based on the table names and the foreign-key
names.

The name is generated in the following format:

-   For object relationships: `singular of foreignTableName`
-   For array relationships: `plural of foreignTableName`

For example, for the foreign-key `article.author_id -> author.id`, the
relationship names will be `author` for `article` table and `articles`
for `author` table.

In case a field with the generated name already exists, a new name will
be generated of the form:
`camel case of (singular/plural of foreignTableName + _by_ + foreignKeyColumnName)`

Note that, **this is just an arbitrary naming convention** chosen by
Hasura to ensure the generation of unique relationship names. You can
choose to rename your relationships to anything you wish. You can
**change the relationship names** with a name of your choice as shown in
`rename_relationships`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
