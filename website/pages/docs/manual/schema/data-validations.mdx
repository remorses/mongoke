Data validations
================

Table of contents

Overview
--------

Many times, we need to perform validations of input data before
inserting or updating objects.

The best solution to implement a validation depends on the complexity of
the validation logic and the layer where you would like to add it.

-   If you would like the validation logic to be a part of your database
    schema, Postgres check constraints or triggers would be ideal
    solutions to add your validation.
-   If you would like the validation logic to be at the GraphQL API
    layer, Hasura permissions can be used to add your validation.
-   If the validation logic requires complex business logic and/or needs
    information from external sources, you can use Hasura Actions to
    perform your validation.

These solutions are explained in some more detail below.

Using Postgres check constraints
--------------------------------

If the validation logic can be expressed by using only static values and
the columns of the table, you can use [Postgres check
constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html).

**Example:** Check that the `rating` for an author is between 1 and 10
only.

Let\'s say we have a table:

```sql
author (id uuid, name text, rating integer)
```

Now, we can head to the `Modify` tab in the table page and add a check
constraint in the `Check Constraints` section:

/img/graphql/manual/schema/validation-add-check-constraint.png

If someone now tries to add an author with a rating of `11`, the
following error is thrown:

  insert_author(
    objects: {
      name: \"Enid Blyton\",
      rating: 11
    }) {
      affected_rows
    }

constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html).

Using Postgres triggers
-----------------------

If the validation logic is more complex and requires the use of data
from other tables and/or functions, then you can use [Postgres
triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html).

**Example:** Validate that an article\'s `content` does not exceed a
certain number of words.

Suppose we have the following table:

```sql
article (id uuid, title text, content text)
```

Now, we can head to the `Data -> SQL` tab in the console and create a
[Postgres
function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html)
that checks if an article\'s content exceeds a certain number of words,
and then add a [Postgres
trigger](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html)
that will call this function every time before an article is inserted or
updated.

```plpgsql
CREATE FUNCTION check_content_length()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
DECLARE content_length INTEGER;
BEGIN
  -- split article content into words and get count
  select array_length(regexp_split_to_array(NEW.content, '\s'),1) INTO content_length;

  -- throw an error if article content is too long
  IF content_length > 100 THEN
      RAISE EXCEPTION 'Content can not have more than 100 words';
  END IF;

  -- return the article row if no error
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER check_content_length_trigger
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON "article"
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE check_content_length();
```

Now, if we try to insert an article whose content has more than 100
words, we\'ll receive the following error:

  insert_article(
    objects: {
      title: \"lorem ipsum\"
      content: \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean et nisl dolor. Nulla eleifend odio et velit aliquet, sed convallis quam bibendum. Cras consequat elit quis est vehicula, nec dignissim dolor cursus. Phasellus suscipit magna ac turpis pulvinar ultricies. Nulla sed lacus sed metus egestas scelerisque nec sed urna. Fusce lorem velit, efficitur sed luctus in, fringilla ac urna. Maecenas fermentum augue sit amet malesuada imperdiet. Suspendisse mattis dignissim quam, at tempor dui tincidunt sed. Maecenas placerat erat nec erat aliquet rutrum. Mauris congue velit nec ultrices dapibus. Duis aliquam, est ac ultricies viverra, ante augue dignissim massa, quis iaculis ex dui in ex. Curabitur pharetra neque ac nisl fringilla, vel pellentesque orci molestie.\",
    }
  ) {
    affected_rows
  }

triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html).

Using Hasura permissions
------------------------

If the validation logic can be expressed **declaratively** using static
values and data from the database, then you can use
`row level permissions <row-level-permissions>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to perform the validations. (Read more about
`Authorization <authorization>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

**Example 1:** Validate that an `article` can be inserted only if
`title` is not empty.

Suppose, we have a table:

```sql
article (id uuid, title text, content text, author_id uuid)
```

Now, we can create a role `user` and add the following rule:

/img/graphql/manual/schema/validation-not-empty.png

If we try to insert an article with `title = ""`, we will get a
`permission-error`:

  insert_article(
    objects: {
      title: \"\"
      content: \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\",
    }
  ) {
    affected_rows
  }


**Example 2:** Validate that an `article` can be inserted only if its
`author` is active.

Suppose, we have 2 tables:

```sql
author (id uuid, name text, is_active boolean)
article (id uuid, author_id uuid, content text)
```

Also, suppose there is an
`object relationship <graphql_relationships>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} `article.author` defined as:

```sql
article.author_id -> author.id
```

Now, we can create a role `user` and add the following rule:

/img/graphql/manual/schema/validation-author-isactive.png

If we try to insert an article for an author for whom
`is_active = false`, we will receive a `permission-error` :

  insert_article(
    objects: {
      title: \"lorem ipsum\"
      content: \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\",
      author_id: 2
    }
  ) {
    affected_rows
  }


Note

Permissions are scoped to a user\'s role. So, if a validation check
needs to be global then you will have to define it for all roles which
have insert/update permissions.

A few features on the roadmap should simplify this experience in the
future.

Using Hasura Actions
--------------------

If the validation requires complex custom business logic and/or needs
information from external sources, you can use
`Actions <actions>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to perform your
validation.

**Example:** Check with an external service that an author\'s name is
not black-listed before inserting them.

Let\'s assume we have an external service that stores and manages
black-listed authors. Before inserting an author we need to check with
this service if they are black-listed or not.

The validation process looks as follows:

/img/graphql/manual/schema/actions-data-validation.png

Actions allow us to define
`custom types <custom_types>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} in our
GraphQL schema.

We create a new action called `InsertAuthor` that takes an `author`
object with type `AuthorInput` as input and returns an object of type
`AuthorOutput`:

/img/graphql/manual/schema/validation-actions-def.png

The business logic of an action - in our case the author validation -
happens in the `action handler <action_handlers>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} which is an HTTP webhook which contains the code to call the
external service.

The following is a sample code that could be added to the event handler
to implement the data validation:

```javascript
function getBlacklistedAuthorsFromApi() {
  // make external api call & return black-listed authors list
}

function insertAuthorViaHasura() {
  // run insert_author mutation & return response
}

const blacklistedAuthors = getBlacklistedAuthorsFromApi();

if (blacklistedAuthors.includes(author.name)) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: "Author is blacklisted" });
} else {
  const insertAuthorResponse = insertAuthorViaHasura();

  return res.json(insertAuthorResponse);
}
```

When we now insert an author, our action handler will be called and it
will check if the author is black-listed. If it\'s not, the author will
be inserted and the `id` will be returned. If the author is
black-listed, we get the following error message:

  InsertAuthor(author: { name: \"Thanos\" }) {
    id
  }
