Metadata catalogue
==================

Table of contents

What is the metadata catalogue?
-------------------------------

The Hasura metadata catalogue is a set of internal tables used to manage
the state of the database and the GraphQL schema. Hasura GraphQL engine
uses the data in the catalogue to generate the GraphQL API which then
can be accessed from different clients.

The Hasura GraphQL engine when initialized, creates a schema called
`hdb_catalog` in the Postgres database and initializes a few tables
under it as described below.

**hdb\_catalog** schema
-----------------------

This schema is created by the Hasura GraphQL engine to manage its
internal state. Whenever a table/permission/relationship is
created/updated using the Hasura console or the metadata API, the Hasura
GraphQL engine captures that information and stores it in the
corresponding tables.

The following tables are used by the Hasura GraphQL engine:

### **hdb\_table** table

This table stores information about all the tables/views which are
created/tracked using the Hasura console or the metadata API.

#### Schema

/img/graphql/manual/engine-internals/hdb\_table.jpg

#### Column Definitions

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  column                description
  --------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  table\_schema         Captures information about the schema under which a
                        table/view is tracked

  table\_name           Captures name of the tracked table/view.

  is\_system\_defined   If it is true, then the table/view is created by GraphQL
                        engine for internal purpose. If it is false, then the
                        table/view is created by the end user.

### **hdb\_relationship** table

This table stores information about the relationships created for
tables/views using the Hasura console or the metadata API.

Note

This section is a work in progress. There have been other tables and
columns added to the catalogue to support new features since this was
last updated.

Exploring the catalogue
-----------------------

You can check the current schema and contents of the catalogue by
exploring the `hdb_catalog` schema through a Postgres client.

Catalogue versioning
--------------------

Whenever the schema of the catalogue is modified *(typically to support
new features)* a new version of the catalogue is generated.

The catalogue version is upgraded automatically on startup if a new
version is available during Hasura GraphQL engine updates.
