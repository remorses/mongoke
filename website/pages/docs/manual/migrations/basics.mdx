Initializing migrations
-----------------------

`Install <install_hasura_cli>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} the Hasura
CLI or `update <hasura_update-cli>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to the
latest version if current version is `< v1.2.0`.

Now run:

```bash
# create a Hasura project
hasura init

# Export current Hasura state
hasura migrate create <init-migration-name> --from-server --endpoint <endpoint>
hasura metadata export --endpoint <endpoint>
```

Generating migrations
---------------------

api\_tabs

Via console

-   Open the Hasura console via the CLI

    ```bash
    hasura console
    ```

-   As you make changes, migration files will be created and latest
    metadata will be exported automatically

Manually

-   Create a new migration

    ```bash
    hasura migrate create <name-of-migration>
    ```

-   Add SQL manually to the `up.sql` and `down.sql` files in the newly
    created migration\'s directory in `/migrations`

-   Edit the corresponding metadata manually in `/metadata`

Managing migrations
-------------------

For maintaining a clean set of migrations with the possibility to move
between different checkpoints in your project\'s state it is recommended
to clean up intermediate DB migration files and to version control the
Hasura project.

### Squash migrations

Typically while adding a feature a lot of incremental migration files
get created for each of the small tasks that you did to achieve the
feature.

Once you are confident about the final state of a feature, you can use
the `migrate squash` command to make a single DB migration file
containing all the intermediate steps required to reach the final state.

```bash
hasura migrate squash --name "<feature-name>" --from <migration-version>
```

### Add checkpoints

As your metadata is exported on every change you make to the schema,
once a final state for a feature is reached you should mark it as a
checkpoint via version control so that you can get back the metadata at
that point.

```bash
git commit -m "<feature-name>"
```

Applying migrations
-------------------

-   Get the Hasura project with the `migrations` and `metadata`
    directories.

-   Apply DB migration files and metadata snapshot

    ```bash
    hasura migrate apply --endpoint <server-endpoint>
    hasura metadata apply --endpoint <server-endpoint>
    ```

Your Hasura server should be up and running!
