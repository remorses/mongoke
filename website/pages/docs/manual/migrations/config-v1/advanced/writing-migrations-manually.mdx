Writing migrations manually (config v1)
=======================================

Table of contents

While the Hasura Console can auto generate migrations for every action,
sometimes you might want to write the migrations yourself, by hand.
Using the Hasura CLI, you can bootstrap these migration files and write
the SQL for the Postgres schema and YAML for Hasura metadata actions.

1.  Set up the migration files:

    ```bash
    hasura migrate create <name-of-migration>
    ```

    This command will create up and down migration yaml files in the
    `migrations` directory.

2.  Edit the file and add your migration actions. For the file format
    and instructions on what actions can be added, refer to
    `migration_file_format_v1`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

3.  Apply the migration:

    ```bash
    hasura migrate apply
    ```
