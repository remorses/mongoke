Managing Hasura metadata (config v1)
====================================

Table of contents

Introduction
------------

If your Postgres schema is already managed with a tool like knex,
TypeORM, Django/Rails migrations, you will still need a way to export
the actions you performed on the Hasura console to apply it later on
another Hasura instance.

All the actions performed on the console, like tracking
tables/views/functions, creating relationships, configuring permissions,
creating event triggers and remote schemas, etc. can be exported as a
JSON/yaml metadata file which can be version controlled. The metadata
file can be later imported to another Hasura instance to get the same
configuration. You can also manually edit the metadata file to add more
objects to it and then use it to update the instance.

Exporting Hasura metadata
-------------------------

api\_tabs

CLI

Metadata can be exported with the
`hasura metadata export <hasura_metadata_export>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} command.

This will export the metadata as a `metadata.yaml` file

Console

1.  Click on the settings (⚙) icon at the top right corner of the
    console screen.
2.  In the Hasura metadata actions page that opens, click on the
    `Export Metadata` button.
3.  This will prompt a file download for
    `hasura_metadata_<timestamp>.json`. Save the file.

API

The export can be done via the `Metadata API
<api_manage_metadata>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Response will be a
JSON object with the Hasura metadata. Here is an example using `curl` to
save this as a file:

```bash
curl -d'{"type": "export_metadata", "args":' http://localhost:8080/v1/query -o hasura_metadata.json
```

This command will create a `hasura_metadata.json` file. If an admin
secret is set, add `-H 'X-Hasura-Admin-Secret: <your-admin-secret>'` as
the API is an admin-only API.

Applying/Importing Hasura metadata
----------------------------------

You can apply exported metadata from one Hasura GraphQL engine instance
to another. You can also apply an older or modified version of an
instance\'s metadata onto itself.

Importing completely replaces the metadata on that instance, i.e. you
lose any metadata that was already present before.

api\_tabs

CLI

An exported `metadata.yaml` file can be applied with the
`hasura metadata apply <hasura_metadata_apply>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} command.

Console

1.  Click on the settings (⚙) icon at the top right corner of the
    console screen.
2.  Click on `Import Metadata` button.
3.  Choose a `hasura_metadata.json` file that was exported earlier.
4.  A notification should appear indicating the success or error.

API

The exported JSON can be imported via the `Metadata API
<api_manage_metadata>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Here is an example
using `curl`:

```bash
curl -d'{"type":"replace_metadata", "args":'$(cat hasura_metadata.json)'}' http://localhost:8080/v1/query
```

This command reads the `hasura_metadata.json` file and makes a POST
request to replace the metadata. If an admin secret is set, add
`-H 'X-Hasura-Admin-Secret: <your-admin-secret>'` as the API is an
admin-only API.

Note

All the dependent objects, like tables, views, functions etc. should
exist on Postgres before importing the metadata. Otherwise, it will
result in an error saying the object does not exist. So, apply the
Postgres schema first, before importing the metadata.

Reloading Hasura metadata
-------------------------

In some cases, the metadata can be out of sync with the Postgres schema.
For example, when a new column has been added to a table via an external
tool such as `psql`.

api\_tabs

CLI

Metadata can be reloaded with the
`hasura metadata reload <hasura_metadata_reload>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} command.

Console

1.  Click on the settings (⚙) icon at the top right corner of the
    console screen.
2.  Click on `Reload` button.
3.  A notification should appear indicating the success.

API

The reload of metadata can be done via the `Metadata API
<api_manage_metadata>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Here is an example
using `curl`:

```bash
curl -d'{"type": "reload_metadata", "args":' http://localhost:8080/v1/query
```

If an admin secret is set, add
`-H 'X-Hasura-Admin-Secret: <your-admin-secret>'` as the API is an
admin-only API.

Note

Reloading may result in inconsistent metadata status. You may need to
resolve all inconsistent objects manually or delete them. After that,
you need to reload metadata again.

Managing Hasura metadata in CI/CD
---------------------------------

In case you need an automated way of applying/importing the metadata,
take a look at the
`cli-migrations <auto_apply_migrations_v1>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} Docker image, which can start the GraphQL engine after
automatically importing a mounted `metadata.yaml` file.
