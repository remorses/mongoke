Install through npm
-------------------

Hasura CLI is available as an npm package that is independently
maintained by some members of the community. It can be beneficial to use
the npm package if you want a version-fixed cli dedicated to your
node.js project. You can find usage details (e.g. flag information) in
the [original repository](https://github.com/jjangga0214/hasura-cli).

```bash
# install as a devDependency of your project
npm install --save-dev hasura-cli[@tag|@version]

# or install globally on your system
npm install --global hasura-cli[@tag|@version]
```

(Optional) Add shell completion
-------------------------------

To add command auto completion in the shell, refer to
`hasura completion <hasura_completion>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
