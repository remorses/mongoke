Deploying Hasura GraphQL engine on Render
=========================================


This guide shows how to deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine on
[Render](https://render.com).

One-Click Deploy on Render
--------------------------

Note

Make sure to [create a free Render account](https://render.com/register)
first.

Once you\'re logged into your Render account, click the button below to
deploy Hasura and a new managed PostgreSQL database wired up to your
Hasura instance.

You will see the Hasura web service and PostgreSQL instance to be
created:

That\'s it! Read on to configure your Hasura instance.

Access your Hasura Console
--------------------------

Once **Deploy to Render** succeeds, you can click through to your Hasura
service page on Render\'s dashboard.

You can monitor the deployment of the Hasura web service from the
**Logs** tab. Once the service is up, use the link on the service page
to access your Hasura console:

```bash
https://<your-hasura-slug>.onrender.com/
```

You can create tables and test your GraphQL queries here.

Check out
`making your first GraphQL query <first_graphql_query>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or
`setting up your first event trigger <first_event_trigger>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more.
