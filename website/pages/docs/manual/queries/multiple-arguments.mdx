Using multiple arguments in a query
===================================

Table of contents

Multiple arguments can be used together in the same query.

For example, you can use the `where` argument to filter the results and
then use the `order_by` argument to sort them.

**For example**, fetch a list of authors and only 2 of their published
articles that are sorted by their date of publication:

  author {
    id
    name
    articles(
      where: {is_published: {_eq: true}},
      order_by: {published_on: desc},
      limit: 2
    ) {
      id
      title
      is_published
      published_on
    }
  }
