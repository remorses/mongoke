Multiple queries in a request
=============================

Table of contents

Execution
---------

If multiple queries are part of the same request, **they are executed in
parallel**, the individual responses are collated and returned. You can
fetch objects of different unrelated types in the same query.

Run multiple top level queries in the same request
--------------------------------------------------

**For example**, fetch a list of `authors` and a list of `articles`:

  author(limit: 2) {
    id
    name
  }
  article(limit: 2) {
    id
    title
  }
