Sort query results
==================

Table of contents

The **order\_by** argument
--------------------------

Results from your query can be sorted by using the `order_by` argument.
The argument can be used to sort nested objects too.

The sort order (ascending vs. descending) is set by specifying the `asc`
or `desc` enum value for the column name in the `order_by` input object,
e.g. `{name: desc}`.

By default, for ascending ordering `null` values are returned at the end
of the results and for descending ordering `null` values are returned at
the start of the results. `null` values can be fetched first on
ascending ordering by specifying `asc_nulls_first` and last on
descending ordering by specifying `desc_nulls_last` enum value e.g.
`{name: desc_nulls_last}`.

The `order_by` argument takes an array of objects to allow sorting by
multiple columns.

You can also use nested objects\' fields to sort the results. Only
**columns from object relationships** and **aggregates from array
relationships** can be used for sorting.

You can see the complete specification of the `order_by` argument in the
`API reference <OrderByExp>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

The following are example queries for different sorting use cases:

Sorting objects
---------------

**Example:** Fetch a list of authors sorted by their names in an
ascending order:

  author (
    order_by: {name: asc}
  ) {
    id
    name
  }


Sorting nested objects
----------------------

**Example:** Fetch a list of authors sorted by their names with a list
of their articles that is sorted by their rating:

  author (order_by: {name: asc}) {
    id
    name
    articles(order_by: {rating: desc}) {
      id
      title
      rating
    }
  }


Sorting based on nested object\'s fields
----------------------------------------

Only **columns from object relationships** and **aggregates from array
relationships** can be used for sorting.

### For object relationships

For object relationships only columns can be used for sorting.

**Example:** Fetch a list of articles that are sorted by their author\'s
ids in descending order:

  article (
    order_by: {author: {id: desc}}
  ) {
    id
    rating
    published_on
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }


### For array relationships

For array relationships only aggregates can be used for sorting.

**Example:** Fetch a list of authors sorted in descending order of their
article count:

  author (
    order_by: {
      articles_aggregate: {count: desc}
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    articles_aggregate {
      aggregate{
        count
      }
    }
  }


**Example:** Fetch a list of authors sorted in increasing order of their
highest article rating:

  author(
    order_by: {
      articles_aggregate: {
        max: {rating: asc_nulls_last}
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    articles_aggregate {
      aggregate{
        maxating
      }
    }
  }


Sorting by multiple fields
--------------------------

**Example:** Fetch a list of articles that is sorted by their rating
(descending) and then on their published date (ascending with nulls
first):

  article (
    order_by: [
      {rating: desc},
      {published_on: asc_nulls_first}
    ]
  ) {
    id
    rating
    published_on
  }
