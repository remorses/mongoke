Distinct query results
======================

Table of contents

The **distinct\_on** argument
-----------------------------

You can fetch rows with only distinct values of a column using the
`distinct_on` argument.

It is typically recommended to use `order_by` along with `distinct_on`
to ensure we get predictable results *(otherwise any arbitrary row with
a distinct value of the column may be returned)*. Note that the
`distinct_on` column needs to be the first column in the `order_by`
expression. See `sort queries <sort_query_results>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more info on using `order_by`.

```graphql
employee (
  distinct_on: [employee_select_column]
  order_by: [employee_order_by]
): [employee]!

# select column enum type for "employee" table
enum employee_select_column {
  id
  name
  department
  salary
}
```

You can see the complete specification of the `distinct_on` argument in
the `API reference <DistinctOnExp>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Fetch results with distinct values of a particular field
--------------------------------------------------------

**For example**, fetch the employee with the highest salary from each
department:

  employee (
    distinct_on: [department]
    order_by: [
      {department: asc},
      {salary: desc}
    ]
  ) {
    id
    name
    department
    salary
  }
