Nested object queries
=====================

Table of contents

You can use the object (one-to-one) or array (one-to-many)
`relationships <relationships>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} defined in
your schema to make a nested query i.e. fetch data for a type along with
data from a nested or related type.

The **name of the nested object** is the same as the name of the
object/array relationship configured in the console.

You can also filter, sort, aggregate and paginate nested objects in case
of array relationships. These are not exposed for object relationships
as they have only one nested object.

Fetch nested object using an object relationship
------------------------------------------------

The following is an example of a nested object query using the **object
relationship** between an article and an author.

**Example:** Fetch a list of articles and the name of each article's
author:

  article {
    id
    title
    author {
      name
    }
  }


Fetch nested objects using an array relationship
------------------------------------------------

The following is an example of a nested object query using the **array
relationship** between an author and articles.

**Example:** Fetch a list of authors and a nested list of each author's
articles:

  author {
    id
    name
    articles {
      id
      title
    }
  }


Note

You can also `filter <nested_filter>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`sort <nested_sort>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`aggregate <nested_aggregate>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`paginate <nested_paginate>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} nested
objects in case of array relationships.
