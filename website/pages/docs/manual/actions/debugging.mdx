Debugging actions
=================

Table of contents

While you\'re developing actions for your application, to debug faster
you may want to see the exact details of the webhook call for the action
as well.

To do so, start the server in
`debugging mode <dev-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. In the case
of errors, the GraphQL response will contain debugging information of
the webhook calls in the `extensions.internal` field.

**For example**:

    create_user(email: \"foo@bar.com\", name: \"Foo\"){
      id
      user {
        name
        email
      }
    }
