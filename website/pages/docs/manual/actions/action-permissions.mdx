Introduction
------------

As with the other fields in the GraphQL schema, users need to be given
access to an action.

Set action permissions

api\_tabs

Console

Head to the `Actions -> [action-name] -> Permissions` tab in the
console.

Hit `Save` to give the role permission to access the action.

CLI

Go to `metadata/actions.yaml` in the Hasura project directory.

Update the definition of the `insertAuthor` action as:

```yaml
- actions
  - name: insertAuthor
    definition:
      kind: synchronous
      handler: '{{ACTIONS_BASE_URL}}/insertAuthor'
    permissions:
    - role: user
    - role: publisher
```

Save the changes and run `hasura metadata apply` to set the permissions.
