Authorization / Access control
==============================

Table of contents

Overview
--------

Hasura supports **role-based** authorization where access control is
done by creating rules for each role, table and operation (*insert*,
*update*, etc.). These access control rules use dynamic session
variables that are passed to the GraphQL engine from your
`authentication service <authentication>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
with every request. Role information is inferred from the
`X-Hasura-Role` and `X-Hasura-Allowed-Roles` session variables. Other
session variables can be passed by your auth service as per your
requirements.

**For example:**

Note

Hasura roles and permissions are implemented at the Hasura layer. They
have nothing to do with Postgres roles and users.

Trying out access control
-------------------------

If you just want to see role-based access control in action, you need
not set up or integrate your auth service with GraphQL engine. You can
just:

-   Define permission rules for a table for a role.
-   Use the GraphiQL interface in the console to make a request and send
    the session variables as request headers (*send a* `X-Hasura-Role`
    *key, with its value as the name of the role you\'ve defined rules
    for*). The data in the response will be restricted as per your
    configuration.

Follow the example at
`access control basics <auth_basics>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
