Configuring Permission Rules
============================

Table of contents

Introduction
------------

Access control rules in Hasura are defined at a role, table and action
(*insert, update, select, delete*) level granularity:

/img/graphql/manual/auth/permission-rule-granularity.png

Requests to Hasura should contain the reserved session variable
`X-Hasura-Role` to indicate the requesting user\'s role, and the table
and action information is inferred from the request itself. This
information is used to determine the right permission rule to be applied
(*if one has been defined*) to the incoming request.

Hasura converts GraphQL queries (*or mutations/subscriptions*) into a
single SQL query that is executed on the configured database instance.
Hasura also includes constraints from permission rules in the SQL query
itself.

Permissions are essentially a combination of **boolean expressions** and
**column selections** that impose constraints on the data being returned
or modified.

Let\'s take a look at the different configuration options available to
define a permission rule. Permission rules are defined for each role,
table, operation (*insert, select, update, delete*) by using the console
or the
`metadata APIs for permissions <api_permission>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Operation permissions
---------------------

### **Select** permissions

For `select` operations or for GraphQL queries, you can configure the
following:

-   `row-level-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `col-level-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `aggr-query-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `limit-rows-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

### **Insert** permissions

For `insert` operations or for GraphQL mutations of the type *insert*,
you can configure the following:

-   `row-level-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `col-level-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `col-presets-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `backend-only-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

### **Update** permissions

For `update` operations or for GraphQL mutations of the type *update*,
you can configure the following:

-   `row-level-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `col-level-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `col-presets-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

### **Delete** permissions

For `delete` operations or for GraphQL mutations of the type *delete*,
you can configure the following:

-   `row-level-permissions`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

Permission categories
---------------------

### Row-level permissions

Row-level premissions are **boolean expressions** that help you restrict
access to rows depending on the operation being performed. E.g. in the
case of `select`, your boolean expression is run on every row to
determine whether that row can be read. In the case of `insert`, the
boolean expression determines whether or not the mutation is allowed.

Row-level permissions are defined using operators, static values, values
in columns (*including those in related tables or nested objects*) and
session variables.

#### Using column operators to build rules

Type-based operators (*depending on the column type*) are available for
constructing row-level permissions. You can use the same operators that
you use to `filter query results <filter_queries>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} along with a few others to define permission rules.

See the `API reference <MetadataOperator>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for a list of all supported column operators.

**For example**, the following two images illustrate the different
operators available for `integer` and `text` types:

/img/graphql/manual/auth/operators-for-integer-types.png

/img/graphql/manual/auth/operators-for-text-types.png

#### Using boolean expressions

The following is an example of a simple boolean expression to restrict
access for `select` to rows where the value in the `id` column is
greater than 10:

/img/graphql/manual/auth/simple-boolean-expression.png

You can construct more complex boolean expressions using the `_and`,
`_or` and `not` operators:

/img/graphql/manual/auth/boolean-operators.png

**For example**, using the `_and` operator, you can construct a rule to
restrict access for `select` to rows where the value in the `id` column
is greater than 10 **and** the value in the `name` column starts with
\"a\" or \"A\":

/img/graphql/manual/auth/composite-boolean-expression.png

#### Using session variables

Session variables that have been resolved from authentication tokens by
either your authentication webhook or by Hasura using the JWT
configuration are available for constructing row-level permissions.

**For example**, to allow an `author` to access only their articles, you
can use the `X-Hasura-User-ID` session variable to construct a rule to
restrict access for `select` to rows in the `articles` table where the
value in the `id` column is equal to the value in the session variable
(*assuming this variable is being used to indicate the author\'s ID*):

/img/graphql/manual/auth/session-variables-in-permissions-simple-example.png

#### Using relationships or nested objects

You can leverage `relationships <relationships>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to define permission rules with fields from a nested object.

**For example**, let\'s say you have an object relationship called
`agent` from the `authors` table to another table called `agent` (*an
author can have an agent*) and we want to allow users with the role
`agent` to access the details of the authors who they manage in
`authors` table. We can define the following permission rule that uses
the aforementioned object relationship:

/img/graphql/manual/auth/nested-object-permission-simple-example.png

This permission rule reads as \"*if the author\'s agent\'s* `id` *is the
same as the requesting user\'s* `id` *, allow access to the author\'s
details*.\"

Array and object relationships work similarly

-   The above example would have worked even if the relationship were an
    array relationship. In our example, the corresponding rule for an
    array relationship would have read \"*if any of this author\'s
    agents\'* `id` *is the same as the requesting user\'s* `id` *, allow
    access to the author\'s details*\".
-   You can also check out this more elaborate
    `example<nested-object-permissions-example>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

#### Using unrelated tables / views

You can use the `_exists` operator to set a permission rule based on
tables/views that are not related to our table.

**For example**, say we want to allow a user to `insert` an `article`
only if the value of the `allow_article_create` column in the `users`
table is set to `true`. Let\'s assume the user\'s id is passed in the
`X-Hasura-User-ID` session variable.

/img/graphql/manual/auth/exists-permission-example.png

This permission rule reads as \"*if there exists a row in the table*
`users` *whose* `id` *is the same as the requesting user\'s* `id` *and
has the* `allow_article_create` *column set to true, allow access to
insert articles*.\"

### Column-level permissions

Column-level permissions determine access to columns in the rows that
are accessible based on row-level permissions. These permissions are
simple selections:

/img/graphql/manual/auth/column-level-permissions.png

In this example, the role `author` has only partial access to columns of
the accessible rows for the `select` operation.

### Row fetch limit

In the case of `select` operations, the number of rows to be returned in
the response can be limited using this configuration:

/img/graphql/manual/auth/limit-rows-for-select.png

In the above example, this configuration restricts the number of
accessible rows (*based on the rule*:
`{"id":{"_eq":"X-Hasura-User-Id"}}`) to 20.

### Aggregation queries permissions

In the case of `select` operations, access to
`aggregation queries <aggregation_queries>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can be restricted for a given role using this configuration.

/img/graphql/manual/auth/aggregation-query-permissions.png

In the above example, the role `user` is allowed to make aggregation
queries.

### Column presets

While this is strictly not a permission configuration, defining
`role-based column presets <column_presets>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} on any column automatically removes access to it. This
preset can be defined for `insert` and `update` operations. This
configuration is also very useful to avoid sending sensitive
user-information in the query and leverage session variables or static
data instead.

### Backend only

If a permission is marked as `backend_only`, the mutation is accessible
to the given role only if `x-hasura-use-backend-only-permissions`
session variable exists and is set to `true` and request is made with
`x-hasura-admin-secret` set if any auth is configured.

This might be useful if you would like to hide a mutation from the
public facing API but allow access to it via a \"trusted backend\".

Note

Setting `backend-only` is currently available for insert mutations only.
