Unauthenticated access
======================

Table of contents

Use case
--------

It is a common requirement to have requests which are accessible to all
users without the need for any authentication (logging in). For example,
to display a public feed of events.

You can configure Hasura GraphQL engine to allow access to
unauthenticated users by defining a specific role which will be set for
all unauthenticated requests.

Configuring unauthenticated access
----------------------------------

You can use the env variable `HASURA_GRAPHQL_UNAUTHORIZED_ROLE` or
`--unauthorized-role` flag to set a role for unauthenticated (non-logged
in) users. See `server_flag_reference`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
more details on setting this flag/env var.

This role can then be used to define the permissions for unauthenticated
users as described in `authorization`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. A
guide on setting up unauthenticated user permissions can be found
`here <anonymous_users_example>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

How it works
------------

Once you have configured authentication, by default Hasura GraphQL
engine will reject any unauthenticated request it receives.

Based on your authentication setup, an unauthenticated request is any
request:

-   for which the webhook returns a `401 Unauthorized` response in case
    of `webhook authentication <auth_webhooks>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
-   which does not contain a JWT token in case of
    `JWT authentication <auth_jwt>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Once an unauthenticated role is configured, unaunthenticated requests
will not be rejected and instead the request will be made with the
configured role.
