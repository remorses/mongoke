Securing the GraphQL endpoint (Docker)
======================================

Table of contents

To make sure that your GraphQL endpoint and the Hasura console are not
publicly accessible, you need to configure an admin secret key.

Run the Docker command with an admin-secret env var
---------------------------------------------------

```bash
#! /bin/bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
 -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@hostname:port/dbname \
 -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE=true \
 -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=myadminsecretkey \
 hasura/graphql-engine:latest
```

Note

The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client
to the Hasura GraphQL engine as it would give the client full admin
rights to your Hasura instance. See `auth`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for information on setting up authentication.
