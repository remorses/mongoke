Securing the GraphQL endpoint (Heroku)
======================================

Table of contents

To make sure that your GraphQL endpoint and the Hasura console are not
publicly accessible, you need to configure an admin secret key.

Add the HASURA\_GRAPHQL\_ADMIN\_SECRET env var
----------------------------------------------

Head to the config-vars URL on your Heroku dashboard and set the
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` environment variable.

Setting this environment variable will automatically restart the dyno.
Now when you access your console, you\'ll be prompted for the admin
secret key.

Note

The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client
to Hasura GraphQL engine as it would give the client full admin rights
to your Hasura instance. See `auth`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
information on setting up authentication.

(optional) Use the admin secret with the CLI
--------------------------------------------

In case you\'re using the CLI to open the Hasura console, use the
`admin-secret` flag when you open the console:

```bash
hasura console --admin-secret=myadminsecretkey
```
